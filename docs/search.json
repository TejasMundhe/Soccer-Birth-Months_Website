I enjoy playing soccer and swimming as well as having a passion for computer science.\r\nAbout the Project\r\nThis project was made through Kaneâ€™s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp to explore the popular theory that more elite athletes are born in January. To investigate this I sorted the number of Euro 2021 players birthdays for each month and made that data into a bar graph\r\nConclusion\r\nAfter making and publishing this plot I learned that a comparable number of players were born in each month with January not being a outlier, proving the theory that more elite athletes are born in January false.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
