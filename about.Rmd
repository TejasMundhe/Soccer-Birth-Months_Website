## About Me
Hi, my name is **Tejas Mundhe** and I am an incoming freshman at Walnut Hills High School. I enjoy playing soccer and swimming as well as having a passion for computer science.

## About the Project
This project was made through [Kaneâ€™s Free High School Data Science Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.davidkane.info) to explore the popular theory that more elite athletes are born in January. To investigate this I sorted the number of Euro 2021 players birthdays for each month and made that data into a bar graph

## Conclusion
After making and publishing this plot I learned that a comparable number of players were born in each month with January not being a outlier, proving the theory that more elite athletes are born in January false.
